A major part of any project teams which have done very well in their software engineering project is
testing.

# Writing tests

Tests should be linked to features you are building. You are testing functions, and these might be in
the user interface (browser testing) or in the backend logic of the way your system operates.
Fundamentally a test is about assurance so every time a feature is added to your application a
corresponding test should be created.

1. Setup and teardown
2. Test pass conditions

## Staging

As your project evolves your team will be expected to have a staging environment (in Docker or
similar) aligned to a specific branch on your repository. The purpose of a STAGING environment is to
ensure that only fully functioning, tested and validated code is pushed to LIVE.

Here is an example workflow of how we might go from feature -> accepted on live.

Feature specification is reviewed and accepted. Test plans written, reviewed and pass Automated
tests written and pass Automated tests are run against the code and pass. Code in repository and
reviewed Pull request against develop branch created. Deployed to staging Browser test plan pass.
Story accepted by PO before the Sprint review.

## Mocha

We are going to be exploring the topic of testing further. Students with an interest should check out [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) in advance.
